## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible Playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) server in a Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.2.1.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [landrush](https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush) plugin) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: idealista.jenkins-role
  version: 1.0.0
  name: jenkins
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - { role: jenkins }
```

## Usage
